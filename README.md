# Phase 1 — Starting My Programming Journey & Choosing Webnode

This is the first phase of my web development journey.  
Here I started learning programming concepts and decided to build a real project instead of just practicing tutorials.

---

## 🎯 Goal of This Phase
- Start my path into programming  
- Learn basic structure, UX thinking and web logic  
- Build a real and functional product  
- Understand limitations of no-code platforms  

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Platform
- Webnode (website builder)  
- Basic HTML / CSS concepts  
- First touch with forms, layouts, UX decisions  

---

## 🚀 What I Built
A real tourism website project called **Vallarta To Explore (VTE)** where I:
- Designed the structure and booking flow  
- Created real business content  
- Tested user experience  
- Started thinking like a developer, not just a user  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned
- How websites are structured  
- Difference between visual builders vs real coding  
- Real user problems → booking, forms, navigation  
- First mindset of *building systems*, not only pages  

---

## 🔜 Next Phase
Learning real coding:
- HTML / CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Backend & Stripe integration  
- Moving from builder → real development
